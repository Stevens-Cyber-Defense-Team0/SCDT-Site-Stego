The complete photo is in `ducklink.jpeg`, although you'll also want to hide `./Components/exif.config` somewhere (well I guess you don't need to hide that file, but if you do that, the folks need to know that `Cheese` is the first password somehow).

# Compiling Stego
Run `./Components/zip.sh` with no password for the first 7zip file, and then add the password `Cheese` for `steghide`.
