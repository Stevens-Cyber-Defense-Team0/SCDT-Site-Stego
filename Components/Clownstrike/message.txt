This "CTF challenge" was kind of inspired by the Clownstrike clusterfuck that happened back in July 2024 where they shut down half the world (take a look here: https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/).

I don't know, but they swore up and down that that `.sys` file with 41kb of null bytes was not the problem ._. 
Surreeeee Clownstrike. It was a "logic error." Not that file full of zeroes though. We don't talk about that. Don't look at that.

If you found this stuff fun, consider joining SCDT! We meet every Monday at 9PM and we try to do things like this. Unlike Clownstrike, we won't blow up your PC.
I kind of made this mini-CTF in like an hour, but if you would like to expand on it, let us know and that's something we could work on :)
