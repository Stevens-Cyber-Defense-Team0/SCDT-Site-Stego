You know - Stevens IT would be losing their minds right now if they knew people were downloading random ~~malware~~ files off DuckLink. But if you got this far, you look like you know what you're doing.

Let's just keep this a secret between the two of us ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The SCDT x Stevens IT lore runs kinda deep. Last semester, we discovered that the Stevens' IMAP servers doesn't actually authenticate people when you send internal emails. In other words, it doesn't check if President Favardin is actually President Favardin. Yeah 4/1 was really fun that year.

Stevens IT also got a "whistleblower report" that we were building nuclear reactors in the basement of Humphreys. Personally, I wouldn't reccommend anyone stepping into that goofy ahh place, but if you ever wanted to play Fallout Shelter IRL, you've joined the right club!

Depending on how many members we get this year in SCDT, I'm thinking of asking others on the eboard to start/launch some cool projects that some of the more experienced people could join in on (maybe another Stevens email "hack" - but keep this between us). If you have any ideas on how to blow up half the world, let us know :)

Alright, that's enough yapping from me. You look like you're trustworthy enough. Here's some top secret classified documents I stole from discord.
