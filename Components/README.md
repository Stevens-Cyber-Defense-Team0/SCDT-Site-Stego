Alright, *before* you get mad at me, I never said the zip file has a password to begin with Â¯\_ (ãƒ„)_/Â¯. And I did tell you there's nothing to see there
Sometimes the best CTF challenges are the ones where you spend hours going down rabbit holes just to find out that the answer was "click the enter button."

For those people that have no idea what I'm talking about, the password for that 7zip file was "". Yeah I am fun at parties.

Speaking of CTFs, hopefully by the time you're reading this, we got approval (and enough members) to go to national competitions such as CCDC, because SDCT used to do that pre-COVID and it was awesome. We're hopefully could try to do some more non-CTF events too like maybe arranging trips to BSidesNYC or getting some guest speakers/professional organizations to speak at meetings (since an old eboard member 2 years ago really wanted SCDT to do this stuff). Kind of depends on how many members we get, but we're tryin'. It'll be awesome if we could collab and co-host a CTF with NJIT or Rutgers too, but that's something I'm looking into.

Here's a description of the `.7z` contents:
* `SCDT.nfc` - That's the .nfc file we used to get you to sign up for our club on Ducklink! Emulate it with your FlipperZero or write it onto a magic card and help give us some clout pls ðŸ¥º. If you would like to know about how the NDEF Exchange Protocols work, just let me know
* `spoof.js` - The code that we're very likely gonna use to send out the first SCDT email reminding you to come to the first meeting
* `Clownstrike.sys` - idk what this does but it BSOD'd half the world. lowkey suspicious large
